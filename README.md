# Minesweeper_Game
here is a version of Minesweeper which I created using OOP(Object Oriented Programming) in Java.
from this version you can enter the size of the "grid" to your choice.
enjoy and feel free to edit the code to your liking.
You need both files in order for the game to work.
let me know what you think and feel free to leave comments or suggestions for improvements:P
